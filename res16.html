		Sisig
	</h1>
Sisig is a popular Filipino dish made from sizzling, crispy, and flavorful pork, often served on a hot plate. It's a great combination of savory, tangy, and spicy flavors. Here’s a simple recipe to make Pork Sisig at home!
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 lb (450g) pork belly (or pork shoulder), boiled and chopped
<br>
1/2 lb (225g) pig's ears (optional, but traditional)
<br>
1 small onion, finely chopped
<br>
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
<br>
2-3 bird's eye chilies (or 1 jalapeño), finely chopped (adjust to your spice <br>
preference)
<br>
2 tablespoons soy sauce
<br>
1 tablespoon vinegar (white or cane vinegar)
<br>
1 tablespoon calamansi or lime juice (optional, but adds a nice tang)
<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
<br>
1/2 cup mayonnaise
<br>
1-2 teaspoons sugar (optional, for balance)
<br>
1-2 tablespoons cooking oil
<br>
1 egg (optional, for topping)
<br>
Chopped green onions, for garnish
<br>
Sizzling plate (optional, for serving)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Boil the Pork:
In a pot, bring water to a boil and add the pork belly and pig's ears (if using). Season with a pinch of salt and simmer for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until the pork is tender.
Once tender, remove the pork and let it cool. Save the broth for future use or discard it.
Cut the pork into small cubes or strips, and chop the pig’s ears into small pieces (if using).
<br>
2. Crisp the Pork:
Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add a little oil.
Fry the boiled pork belly pieces (and pig's ears, if using) until they are crispy and golden brown on all sides. This may take about 10-15 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
<br>
3. Sauté the Aromatics:
In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed. Sauté the chopped onions and garlic until they are soft and fragrant (about 3-5 minutes).
Add the chopped bird’s eye chilies (or jalapeño) and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
<br>
4. Combine the Ingredients:
Add the crispy pork back into the pan with the onions and garlic.
Pour in the soy sauce, vinegar, and calamansi (or lime juice). Stir everything well and cook for another 2-3 minutes to let the flavors meld.
Season with salt, pepper, and sugar (if using). Adjust the seasoning to your taste.
<br>
5. Mix in the Mayonnaise:
Turn off the heat and stir in the mayonnaise until everything is well-coated. The mayo will give the sisig its creamy texture and richness.
<br>
6. Serve:
If you have a sizzling plate, you can heat the sisig mixture on it to make it sizzle when served. Just transfer the sisig mixture to a hot plate and crack an egg on top (if desired).
Garnish with chopped green onions for added freshness and serve immediately with steamed rice.

<br>
Enjoy your homemade Pork Sisig with a cold drink, and don’t forget to mix the egg into the sisig for an extra creamy finish!

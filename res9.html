	</h1>
Bacsilog is a popular Filipino breakfast dish consisting of bacon (bac), sinangag (garlic fried rice), and a fried egg (itlog). It's a savory, flavorful, and hearty meal that is quick to prepare and perfect for starting the day. Here’s a simple recipe for Bacsilog:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Bacon (Bac):
<br>
4-6 slices of bacon (preferably thick-cut)
<br>
1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional, for sweetness)
<br>
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
<br>
1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional, for extra flavor)
<br>
For the Garlic Fried Rice (Sinangag):
<br>
2 cups cooked rice (preferably cold, day-old rice works best)
<br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter
<br>
3-4 cloves garlic (minced)
<br>
Salt to taste
<br>
For the Fried Egg:
<br>
2 large eggs
<br>
1 tablespoon oil (for frying)
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Bacon (Bac):
In a pan over medium heat, cook the bacon slices until they are crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. Flip them halfway through to ensure even cooking.
If you'd like your bacon to have a slight sweetness, sprinkle the bacon with 1 tablespoon of brown sugar in the last minute of cooking, then allow it to caramelize slightly.
Once cooked, remove the bacon from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess grease.
<br>
2. Make the Garlic Fried Rice (Sinangag):
In the same pan, remove excess bacon fat, leaving about 1-2 tablespoons for flavor. If there’s not enough, add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or butter.
Add the minced garlic and sauté over medium heat until fragrant and golden brown, about 1-2 minutes.
Add the cold, day-old rice to the pan. Break up any clumps and stir-fry for 3-5 minutes until the rice is heated through and slightly crispy.
Season the rice with salt to taste. If desired, you can also add a pinch of pepper.
Once the rice is cooked and flavored, set it aside and keep it warm.
<br>
3. Fry the Eggs:
In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat.
Crack the eggs into the pan, and fry them sunny-side-up or to your preferred level of doneness. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
<br>
4. Assemble the Bacsilog:
On a plate, serve a generous portion of garlic fried rice (sinangag).
Place the cooked bacon on the side.
Top with a fried egg.
You can garnish with extra toppings like fried garlic chips or pickled vegetables (atsara) if desired.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Rice: If you don’t have day-old rice, you can use freshly cooked rice, but it’s best to cool it down first to avoid a mushy texture when frying.
Sweet bacon: If you prefer a sweeter flavor for your bacon, you can use a little honey or maple syrup instead of brown sugar for a more caramelized effect.
<br>
Customization: Add some sautéed vegetables like bell peppers or onions to the garlic fried rice for extra flavor and nutrients.
<br>
Bacsilog is a simple, satisfying meal that’s perfect for breakfast or any time you want a filling, flavorful dish. Enjoy this Filipino classic!

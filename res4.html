<h1>Pento Box</h1>	
A Pento box is a Japanese-Filipino-style lunchbox that typically includes a variety of small, balanced portions of different foods. A grilled chicken with lime flavor would be a great addition to your bento, and it can be paired with a few side dishes to create a complete meal. Here's a recipe for a Bento Box with Grilled Chicken and Limes:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Grilled Chicken:
<br>
2 chicken breasts or thighs (boneless, skinless)
<br>
2 tbsp olive oil
<br>
2 tbsp soy sauce
<br>
1 tbsp honey or maple syrup
<br>
2 tbsp lime juice (freshly squeezed)
<br>
1 tsp lime zest
<br>
2 cloves garlic (minced)
<br>
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
<br>
Salt to taste
<br>
1 tsp sesame oil (optional, for extra flavor)
<br>
For the Rice:
<br>
1 cup cooked rice (preferably short-grain or medium-grain)
<br>
1 tbsp rice vinegar
<br>
1 tsp sugar
<br>
A pinch of salt
<br>
For the Sides:
<br>
1/2 cup cucumber (thinly sliced)
<br>
1/2 cup cherry tomatoes (halved)
<br>
1/2 cup steamed broccoli or edamame (or any vegetable you like)
<br>
1 boiled egg (optional, peeled and halved)
<br>
Lime wedges (for garnish)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Grilled Chicken:
In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, soy sauce, honey, lime juice, lime zest, minced garlic, pepper, and salt. If using sesame oil, add it to the marinade for an extra depth of flavor.
Marinate the chicken: Place the chicken breasts or thighs into the marinade, making sure the chicken is fully coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours in the fridge for maximum flavor.
Grill the chicken: Preheat your grill, grill pan, or outdoor grill over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C), and the chicken is golden and cooked through.
Once grilled, remove the chicken from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into bite-sized pieces.
<br>
2. Prepare the Rice:
Cook the rice according to the package instructions. Once cooked, place the rice in a bowl while it's still warm.
In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of salt until dissolved. Drizzle this mixture over the cooked rice and stir gently to combine. Let the rice cool down a bit before packing it into the bento box.
<br>
3. Prepare the Sides:
Cucumber: Slice the cucumber thinly and set it aside. You can season it with a little salt or rice vinegar for extra flavor if desired.
Cherry tomatoes: Halve the cherry tomatoes and set them aside. These add color and freshness to the bento.
Steamed vegetables: Steam the broccoli or edamame until tender, about 3-5 minutes. You can also use any vegetable you like, such as carrots or snap peas.
Boiled egg: If you want to add a boiled egg to your bento, simply boil an egg, peel it, and cut it in half.
<br>
4. Assemble the Bento Box:
In your bento box, arrange a portion of the rice on one side.
Place the grilled chicken pieces next to the rice.
Add the sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, and steamed broccoli (or other vegetables) in the remaining spaces of the box.
Add a boiled egg (if using) as one of the side dishes.
Garnish with lime wedges for a fresh touch and extra lime flavor.
<br>
5. Optional Garnishes:
You can garnish the bento with some sesame seeds, chopped herbs (like cilantro or parsley), or a little extra lime zest for additional flavor.
Tips:
Rice substitution: If you want to make it more traditional, use Japanese short-grain rice, which is sticky and perfect for bento. If you prefer a healthier option, you can use brown rice or cauliflower rice.
Vegetable variety: You can add any vegetable you prefer, like bell peppers, snap peas, or leafy greens like spinach or lettuce.
Packing tips: Use dividers or small containers in your bento box to keep the ingredients from touching each other and to maintain the freshness of each component.
This Grilled Chicken Bento Box with Lime is a flavorful, balanced, and portable meal perfect for lunch or dinner. Enjoy!

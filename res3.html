<h1>Omurice</h1>

Omurice (オムライス) is a delicious Japanese comfort food made by combining fried rice with a fluffy, soft omelette. The rice is typically seasoned with ketchup and filled with vegetables, chicken, or ham. The omelette is delicately folded over the rice. Here's a recipe for making Omurice at home!
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Fried Rice:
<br>
2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old rice)
<br>
1/2 cup chicken breast or thighs (diced) or ham (diced)
<br>
1/2 onion (chopped)
<br>
1/2 cup mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, corn, etc.)
<br>
2 cloves garlic (minced)
<br>
2 tbsp ketchup
<br>
1 tbsp soy sauce
<br>
1 tbsp butter or vegetable oil
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
<br>
For the Omelette:
<br>
2 large eggs
<br>
1 tbsp milk (optional, for fluffier omelette)
<br>
1 tsp butter or oil
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
<br>
Garnish:
<br>
Extra ketchup (for topping)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
<br>
1. Make the Fried Rice:
Cook the chicken or ham: In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of butter or oil over medium heat. Add the diced chicken (or ham) and cook until fully cooked and lightly browned. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Cook the vegetables: In the same pan, add a bit more oil if necessary. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.
Add the mixed vegetables and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until they're heated through and tender.
Fry the rice: Add the cooked rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir well to combine with the vegetables and cook for 3-4 minutes, allowing the rice to fry a bit and get some color.
Season: Add 2 tablespoons of ketchup and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. Stir to coat the rice evenly. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix in the cooked chicken or ham. Remove from heat and set aside.
<br>
<br>
2. Make the Omelette:
In a bowl, beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon of milk (if using) and a pinch of salt and pepper.
Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and melt 1 teaspoon of butter (or oil). Once the butter is melted, pour in the beaten eggs.
Cook the omelette: Allow the eggs to cook gently for 1-2 minutes, swirling the pan to ensure they cook evenly. When the eggs are still slightly runny on top (but mostly set), remove from heat. The omelette should be soft and slightly wobbly, not fully cooked through.
<br>
<br>
3. Assemble the Omurice:
Place a generous serving of fried rice in the center of a plate.
Fold the omelette: Carefully slide the omelette onto the rice, positioning it so that the center of the omelette is over the rice. You can fold the omelette in half or leave it slightly open to reveal the rice inside.
Garnish: Drizzle a little ketchup over the top of the omelette for the classic Omurice presentation.
<br>
<br>
4. Serve:
Serve the omurice immediately, and enjoy this comforting dish!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Use day-old rice: Freshly cooked rice tends to be too soft and sticky for fried rice. <br>
Day-old rice (refrigerated overnight) works best for achieving the right texture.
<br>
Customize the filling: You can add any vegetables or proteins you prefer, such as bell peppers, mushrooms, or shrimp.
<br>
For a fluffier omelette: Adding a little milk or cream to the beaten eggs helps make the omelette fluffier and softer.

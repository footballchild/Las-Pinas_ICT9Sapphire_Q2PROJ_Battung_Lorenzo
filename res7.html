		Puto
	</h1>
Puto is a popular Filipino steamed rice cake made from rice flour, sugar, and coconut milk, resulting in a light and fluffy texture. Itâ€™s often served as a snack or dessert, and can be topped with cheese or salted egg for added flavor. Here's a simple and delicious recipe for Puto:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
2 cups rice flour (or all-purpose flour, if you prefer)
<br>
1/2 cup sugar
<br>
<br>
1 tablespoon baking powder
<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt
<br>
1 cup coconut milk (or regular milk)
<br>
1/4 cup water
<br>
1 large egg
<br>
1/4 cup melted butter or vegetable oil
<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
<br>
<br>
Optional toppings:
<br>
Cheese (preferably cheddar cheese, cut into small cubes or strips)
<br>
Salted eggs (sliced, for a savory twist)
<br>
<br>
Equipment:
<br>
Steamer
<br>
Muffin or cupcake molds (or a puto mold)
<br>
Mixing bowls
<br>
Whisk or spoon
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Steamer:
Fill the steamer with water and bring it to a boil. Make sure the water level is sufficient to create steam for about 30 minutes, and the steam can circulate around the molds.
Lightly grease your muffin or cupcake molds to prevent the puto from sticking. Alternatively, you can line them with cupcake liners.
<br>
2. Make the Puto Batter:
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the rice flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
In a separate bowl, whisk the egg, then add the coconut milk (or regular milk), water, melted butter or oil, and vanilla extract (if using). Mix until well combined.
Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring continuously until a smooth batter forms. Make sure there are no lumps.
<br>
3. Steam the Puto:
Pour the batter into the prepared molds, filling them about 3/4 full.
If you are adding toppings, place a small cube of cheese or a slice of salted egg on top of each batter-filled mold before steaming.
Carefully place the filled molds into the steamer. Cover the steamer with a clean kitchen towel, and then put the lid on. This prevents water from dripping onto the batter as it steams.
Steam the puto over medium heat for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick or skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.
<br>
4. Check the Puto:
Once steamed, remove the puto from the steamer and allow them to cool slightly before serving.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Consistency: If the batter is too thick, add a little more water or coconut milk to reach a smooth consistency. The batter should be pourable but not runny.
<br>
Steaming time: Steaming time may vary depending on the size of the molds. Small molds usually take around 20-25 minutes, while larger ones may take longer.
<br>
Flavor variations: You can try different variations, such as adding pandan extract for a fragrant twist or ube (purple yam) for a colorful and flavorful option.
<br>
Serve your puto warm or at room temperature. Enjoy this soft and fluffy Filipino treat with your favorite toppings!

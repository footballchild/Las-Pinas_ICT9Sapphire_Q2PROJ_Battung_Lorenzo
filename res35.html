		Turon

Turon is a popular Filipino snack made with saba bananas (or plantains), sometimes with added jackfruit, wrapped in a crispy spring roll wrapper, and then fried to a golden, crunchy perfection. It's often caramelized with brown sugar for extra sweetness. Here's a simple recipe for Turon:

Turon Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
4 saba bananas (or 2 medium-sized plantains)
<br>
1/2 cup jackfruit (optional, use sweetened or fresh jackfruit, cut into strips)
<br>
1/2 cup brown sugar (for caramelizing)
<br>
8-10 spring roll wrappers (available at most grocery stores)
<br>
Vegetable oil for frying
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Prepare the Bananas:
Peel the saba bananas and slice them lengthwise into halves or quarters, depending on how large they are. If you're using plantains, cut them into long slices about the size of your spring roll wrappers.
If using jackfruit, cut it into thin strips.
<br>
2.Caramelize the Sugar:
In a shallow dish, spread the brown sugar evenly. This is what will coat the bananas for the crispy, caramelized finish. You can also add a pinch of salt to balance the sweetness.
<br>
3.Assemble the Turon:
Lay a spring roll wrapper flat on a clean surface, with one corner pointing towards you (like a diamond shape).
Place one piece of the sliced banana in the center of the wrapper. If you're using jackfruit, add a few strips of jackfruit alongside the banana.
Sprinkle the banana and jackfruit with a little bit of the brown sugar.
Carefully fold the bottom corner over the filling, then fold in the sides, and roll tightly to form a sealed package. Make sure the edges are well sealed by moistening them with a little water.
<br>
4.Fry the Turon:
Heat a generous amount of vegetable oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. The oil should be deep enough to submerge the turon.
Once the oil is hot, carefully add the wrapped turon one by one. Fry the turon in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
Fry for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy. You may want to sprinkle a little more brown sugar into the oil while frying to help caramelize the wrappers.
<br>
5.Drain and Serve:
Once crispy and golden brown, remove the turon from the pan and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.
Let them cool for a minute, then serve your turon immediately.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Sugar Coating: For extra caramelization, you can add a bit of the brown sugar to the oil as you fry the turon. This creates a crispy, sweet coating on the outside.
<br>
Serving Suggestions: Turon can be enjoyed as a snack on its own or served with a drizzle of honey or chocolate syrup for an extra treat.

Turon is a delicious, sweet, and crunchy snack thatâ€™s easy to make and perfect for any occasion!

<br>
<br>
Biko Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
<br>
For the Rice:
<br>
2 cups glutinous rice (also known as sticky rice or malagkit rice)
<br>
4 cups water
<br>
<br>
For the Topping:
<br>
1 can (400 ml) coconut milk
<br>
1 1/2 cups brown sugar (preferably dark brown)
<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Cook the Glutinous Rice:
Rinse the glutinous rice in water to remove excess starch.
In a large pot, combine the rice with 4 cups of water. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook the rice for about 15-20 minutes, or until the water is absorbed and the rice is soft. You may need to add more water if it dries out before the rice is fully cooked.
<br>
2.Make the Coconut Milk Mixture:
In a separate pan, combine the coconut milk, brown sugar, and salt over medium heat. Stir constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture starts to simmer. Continue to cook, stirring often, for about 10-15 minutes until the mixture thickens and becomes slightly syrupy.
<br>
3.Combine Rice and Coconut Mixture:
Once the rice is cooked, pour the coconut milk mixture into the rice and stir gently until fully combined. Continue to cook the rice mixture over low heat for an additional 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking. The mixture should become thick and sticky.
<br>
4.Transfer to a Dish:
Once the rice is thickened and all the coconut mixture has been absorbed, transfer the biko to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish or any dish of your choice. Use a spatula to press it down firmly, smoothing the top.
<br>
5.Serve:
Allow the biko to cool at room temperature, then cut it into squares or diamonds for serving.
<br>
<br>
6.Enjoy:
Enjoy your sweet, chewy biko with family and friends!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Topping Variation: Some versions of biko have a caramelized coconut topping. To make this, use some of the coconut milk and brown sugar mixture to cook down until it becomes a thick caramel, then pour it over the rice before serving.
<br>
Storage: Biko can be stored at room temperature for a few days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.
<br>
Biko is a comforting and sweet Filipino delicacy that pairs perfectly with coffee or tea. Enjoy!

	<h1>Pandesal</h1>
Pandesal is a popular Filipino bread roll, known for its soft, fluffy texture and slightly sweet taste. It's a beloved breakfast item in the Philippines, typically enjoyed with butter, cheese, or jam. Here's a simple recipe to make homemade pandesal:
<br>
<br>

Ingredients:
<br>
4 cups all-purpose flour
<br>
1/2 cup sugar
<br>
2 teaspoons instant yeast
<br>
1 teaspoon salt
<br>
1/2cup warm milk (about 110°F / 43°C)
<br>
1/2 cup water (room temperature)
<br>
2 large eggs
<br>
1/4 cup unsalted butter (softened)
<br>
1/4 cup breadcrumbs (for coating the rolls)
<br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for greasing)
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
<br>
1. Prepare the Dough:
In a large mixing bowl, combine 4 cups of all-purpose flour, sugar, instant yeast, and salt. Stir to combine.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the warm milk, water, eggs, and softened butter. The milk should be warm to the touch but not too hot (about 110°F / 43°C), as this helps activate the yeast.
Gradually pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Use a spatula or your hands to mix until a dough starts to form.
<br>
2. Knead the Dough:
Transfer the dough to a clean, lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, add a little flour, a tablespoon at a time, until it is manageable.
Once kneaded, place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size.
<br>
3. Shape the Pandesal:
After the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll it into a log shape. Then, cut the dough into small pieces, about 1.5 to 2 inches in size.
Roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball and then roll it in breadcrumbs, ensuring it’s fully coated. The breadcrumbs give pandesal its signature texture and flavor.
Place each ball onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving a little space between each one.
<br>
4. Second Rise:
Cover the shaped dough with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let them rise again for 30 minutes, or until they have puffed up and are nearly doubled in size.
<br>
5. Bake the Pandesal:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Once the dough has risen, place the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the pandesal is golden brown on top.
Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Milk temperature: Be sure that the milk is warm but not hot, as water that's too hot can kill the yeast.
<br>
Yeast: You can use active dry yeast instead of instant yeast, but you’ll need to activate it in warm water with a pinch of sugar before using it in the dough.
<br>
Bread crumbs: The traditional pandesal is coated in fine bread crumbs, but if you want extra crunch, you can use panko breadcrumbs.
<br>
For a softer texture: If you want a softer, fluffier pandesal, you can replace some of the all-purpose flour with bread flour, which has more gluten.

<br>
Enjoy your freshly baked pandesal with butter, cheese, or jam for a delightful Filipino breakfast!

	<h1> Tamago Kake Gohan </h1>
Tamagokake Gohan (卵かけご飯) is a simple, traditional Japanese dish that consists of a raw egg mixed with hot rice, seasoned with soy sauce. It's comforting, quick, and delicious, often enjoyed for breakfast. Here's how you can make Tamagokake Gohan at home:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 cup short-grain or medium-grain rice (cooked and hot)
<br>
1 fresh egg (make sure it’s very fresh, since it will be consumed raw)
<br>
1-2 tsp soy sauce (to taste)
<br>
1/2 tsp mirin (optional, for a touch of sweetness)
<br>
A pinch of salt (optional)
<br>
Garnishes (optional): chopped green onions, sesame seeds, or nori (seaweed)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Cook the Rice:
Cook the rice according to the package instructions or using a rice cooker. The rice should be freshly cooked and hot when you serve it for tamagokake gohan.
<br>
2. Prepare the Egg:
Crack the egg into a small bowl. You can use a fresh egg directly from the shell. Some people choose to gently beat the egg with chopsticks or a fork to slightly break up the yolk.
<br>
3. Season the Egg:
Add 1-2 teaspoons of soy sauce to the egg, and mix gently. If you prefer a slightly sweeter flavor, add 1/2 teaspoon of mirin (optional). You can also add a pinch of salt for extra flavor if desired.
<br>
4. Assemble the Tamagokake Gohan:
Place the hot rice into a bowl.
Pour the seasoned egg mixture over the hot rice. The heat from the rice will gently cook the egg, creating a creamy, silky texture when mixed.
<br>
5. Mix and Serve:
Stir the egg mixture into the rice until fully incorporated. The egg will blend into the rice, giving it a smooth, rich texture.
<br>
6. Optional Garnishes:
You can top your tamagokake gohan with chopped green onions, sesame seeds, or shredded nori (seaweed) for added flavor and texture.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Freshness of the egg: Since the egg is raw, it is important to use the freshest egg possible. If you're concerned about raw eggs, consider using pasteurized eggs, which are safe to eat raw.
<br>
Rice: Make sure the rice is hot when you pour the egg over it, as this helps cook the egg slightly and gives the dish a smooth, creamy texture.
<br>
Customization: You can customize the dish by adding other toppings, like grated daikon, pickles, or a drizzle of sesame oil.
Tamagokake Gohan is simple, comforting, and a perfect quick meal! Enjoy it as a breakfast, a snack, or even a light dinner.

<br>
Leche Flan Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Caramel:
<br>
<br>
1 cup sugar
<br>
1/4 cup water
<br>
<br>
For the Flan:
<br>
8 large egg yolks
<br>
1 can (380 ml) condensed milk
<br>
1 can (370 ml) evaporated milk
<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
<br>
1/4 cup sugar (optional, for sweetness adjustment)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Make the Caramel:
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup water.
Stir gently until the sugar dissolves, then stop stirring. Let it simmer until it turns a golden amber color (about 8-10 minutes). Keep an eye on it so it doesn’t burn.
Once the caramel reaches the desired color, immediately pour it into your flan mold or individual ramekins. Swirl the mold to coat the bottom evenly with caramel. Set aside to cool and harden while you make the flan mixture.
<br>
2.Prepare the Flan Mixture:
In a mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/4 cup sugar (optional, depending on how sweet you like it). Be careful not to overwhisk or add too much air.
Add the condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract. Mix gently until well combined. Don’t whisk too vigorously, as it may cause bubbles in the mixture.
<br>
3.Strain the Flan Mixture:
To ensure a smooth, creamy texture, strain the flan mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a separate bowl or pitcher to remove any egg bits or air bubbles.
<br>
4.Pour the Flan Mixture into the Mold:
Carefully pour the flan mixture over the hardened caramel in your mold or ramekins. Fill to about 3/4 of the way to the top, as the flan will expand slightly during cooking.
<br>
5.Steam or Bake the Leche Flan:
To steam: Place the flan mold in a large steamer over medium heat. Cover and steam for about 30-45 minutes, or until the flan is set. You can check for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the flan—it should come out clean.
To bake: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Prepare a water bath by placing the flan mold in a larger baking pan, filling the pan with hot water to about halfway up the sides of the flan mold. Bake for 45-60 minutes, or until the flan is set (a toothpick should come out clean when inserted).
<br>
6.Cool the Flan:
Allow the leche flan to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 2-3 hours or overnight to fully set.
<br>
7.Serve:
To serve, run a knife around the edges of the flan to loosen it, then carefully invert the mold onto a plate. The caramel will flow over the flan as a delicious sauce.
<br>
8.Enjoy:
Enjoy your creamy, rich leche flan!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Avoid Air Bubbles: When mixing the custard, try not to incorporate too much air, as this can lead to a bubbly texture in the final product.
<br>
Caramel Color: If your caramel turns too dark or starts to burn, you may need to start over. Once the caramel is poured into the mold, it hardens quickly, so work fast.
<br>
Baking Option: If you don't have a steamer, baking in a water bath is a great alternative to achieve that smooth, creamy texture.
<br>
Leche flan is a deliciously indulgent dessert that’s perfect for family gatherings or special occasions. Enjoy making this Filipino classic!

<h1>Natto</h1>

<body>
Fermented soybeans, known as Natto in Japan, is a traditional dish made by fermenting soybeans with a specific type of bacteria called Bacillus subtilis. It’s known for its unique texture (sticky, stringy) and strong flavor. Making natto at home can be a fun and rewarding project. Here's a simple recipe to help you create your own fermented soybeans.
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
2 cups dried soybeans
<br>
1/2 tsp natto starter (Bacillus subtilis) or a small amount of store-bought natto (as a starter culture)
<br>
Water (for soaking and boiling)
<br>
Equipment:
<br>
Large pot (for soaking and boiling soybeans)
<br>
Steamer or a large pan (for steaming the beans)
<br>
Fermentation container (such as a glass or plastic container with a lid)
<br> 
thermometer (to monitor temperature)
<br>
 clean towel or cheesecloth (to cover the beans)
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Soybeans:
Soak the soybeans: Rinse the dried soybeans thoroughly, then soak them in plenty of water for 12-24 hours. The beans will expand as they absorb the water, so ensure the water level is at least a few inches above the beans.
Boil the soybeans: After soaking, drain the beans and transfer them to a large pot. Fill the pot with fresh water, covering the beans. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the beans for about 3-4 hours, or until they are tender but not mushy. You can also use a pressure cooker for faster cooking (about 45 minutes under pressure).
<br>
2. Sterilize the Equipment:
Clean all equipment that will come into contact with the beans (fermentation container, spoon, etc.) using hot water and vinegar or lemon juice to sterilize it. This prevents unwanted bacteria from affecting the fermentation process.
<br>
3. Inoculate the Beans:
Once the soybeans are cooked and still hot (but not boiling), prepare the natto starter. If you're using store-bought natto as the starter, take a small portion (about a tablespoon) and mash it into a paste with a bit of water. If you're using a powdered natto starter, dissolve it in a small amount of warm water as directed on the package.
Stir the starter mixture into the hot soybeans, making sure they are evenly coated with the starter culture.
<br>
4. Ferment the Soybeans:
Transfer the inoculated soybeans into a clean fermentation container. Spread them out into a thin layer, but not too tightly packed. It’s important that the beans are able to "breathe" during fermentation, so do not overcrowd them.
Cover the container with a clean towel or cheesecloth to allow airflow.
Place the container in a warm, stable environment (around 100°F / 38°C) to ferment for 24 to 48 hours. You can use an incubator, a warm oven (with just the light on), or a yogurt maker. You could also wrap the container in a towel and place it in a warm area, such as an insulated cooler.
Check periodically: The beans should begin to develop a sticky, stringy texture and a strong odor after 24 hours. The longer you ferment, the stronger the flavor becomes. 48 hours is ideal for a more pronounced flavor.

<br>5. Refrigerate:
After fermentation, place the natto in the refrigerator to slow down the fermentation process. Let it sit in the fridge for at least 12 hours before eating, as this helps the flavor develop further.
Serving:
Natto can be eaten in various ways, most commonly served with steamed rice, sometimes with a dash of soy sauce, mustard, or chopped green onions. It is also often enjoyed with raw egg or added to sushi rolls.

<br>

Tips:
Flavor and texture: The more time you let the natto ferment, the stronger the flavor and stickier the texture will be. If it's your first time making natto, start with a shorter fermentation time (around 24 hours).
Starter culture: If you don’t have natto starter, you can use a tablespoon of store-bought natto as your culture. Just mash it up and mix it in with your cooked beans.
<br>
Cleanliness: Fermentation is sensitive to contamination, so make sure everything that touches the soybeans is clean and sterilized to avoid introducing unwanted bacteria.
Enjoy your homemade natto!

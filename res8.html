		Furikake
	</h1>
Furikake on top of steaming rice is a simple and delicious way to enjoy this savory Japanese seasoning. The heat from the freshly steamed rice allows the furikake to melt slightly, infusing the rice with umami flavor and texture. Here's how you can easily make and serve furikake rice:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
2 cups cooked rice (preferably short-grain or medium-grain rice)
<br>
2-3 tablespoons furikake (store-bought or homemade – see previous recipe)
<br>
Optional toppings:
<br>
A dash of soy sauce (for added flavor)
<br>
A small drizzle of sesame oil (for extra richness)
<br>
A soft-boiled or poached egg (for added richness)
<br>
Pickled vegetables or umeboshi (pickled plum)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Cook the Rice:
Prepare 2 cups of rice using your preferred method (rice cooker, stovetop, or pressure cooker). It's best to use freshly steamed or hot rice, as the heat will help release the aromas and flavors of the furikake.
<br>
2. Serve the Rice:
Once the rice is cooked, fluff it gently with a fork or rice paddle. Serve the rice into individual bowls while it's still hot and steaming.
<br>
3. Sprinkle Furikake:
Sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons of furikake on top of the steaming rice. You can adjust the amount based on your personal taste – more for a stronger flavor, or less for a subtler taste.
<br>
4. Optional Enhancements:
<br>
Soy Sauce: For an extra layer of flavor, drizzle a small amount of soy sauce over the rice before serving.
<br>
Sesame Oil: A drop or two of sesame oil can enhance the aroma and richness of the rice.
<br>
Egg: If you'd like a heartier dish, top the rice with a soft-boiled egg, poached egg, or a scrambled egg.
<br>
Pickled Vegetables: Serve with pickled vegetables or umeboshi (Japanese pickled plums) on the side for a tangy contrast.
<br>
5. Serve and Enjoy:
Mix the furikake into the rice before eating to evenly distribute the seasoning. The combination of flavors and textures will bring the dish to life!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Freshly steamed rice: Furikake works best on rice that’s still warm because the heat helps release the flavors from the seasoning.
<br>
Customize your furikake: You can customize the furikake with additional flavors such as chili flakes, dried fish, or even a sprinkle of sugar for sweetness.
<br>
Furikake rice is a versatile dish that’s perfect for a quick meal, breakfast, or a side dish. Enjoy the comforting, umami-packed combination of furikake and rice!

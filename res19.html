		Water
	</h1>
Water itself doesn't need a recipe, as it is the simplest and most essential element on Earth! But if you’re looking to enhance water with natural flavors or infusions, here are a few ideas:
<br>
<br>
1. Infused Water (Fruit-Infused Water)
Fruit-infused water is a great way to add flavor without adding sugar or calories. It's refreshing, hydrating, and very easy to make.
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 pitcher of cold water (about 4 cups)
<br>
1-2 cups of fruit (choose one or a mix of your favorites):
<br>
Lemon slices
<br>
Lime slices
<br>
Cucumber slices
<br>
Strawberries, sliced
<br>
Mint leaves
<br>
Oranges or berries (blueberries, raspberries)
<br>
Ice (optional)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
Prepare the Ingredients: Slice your chosen fruits and herbs. You can use a combination of fruits, herbs, and even spices like ginger or cinnamon sticks for extra flavor.
<br>
Infuse the Water: Add the sliced fruits, herbs, and any other additions to a pitcher of cold water.
<br>
Chill and Serve: Let the water sit in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours (or overnight for a stronger flavor). The longer it sits, the more the flavors will infuse into the water.
<br>
Serve: Pour the infused water into glasses over ice, and enjoy!
<br>

Add the cucumber slices and fresh mint leaves to a pitcher of water.
<br>
Let it sit in the fridge for at least 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend.

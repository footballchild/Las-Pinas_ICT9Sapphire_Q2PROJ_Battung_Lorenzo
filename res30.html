<br>
<br>
Taiyaki Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Batter:
<br>
1 cup all-purpose flour
<br>
1/2 cup cornstarch
<br>
1/4 cup sugar
<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder
<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt
<br>
1 large egg
<br>
1/2 cup milk
<br>
2 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted)
<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
<br>
1/4 cup water (adjust as needed to get the right batter consistency)
<br>
<br>
For the Filling:
<br>
Sweet red bean paste (anko), or you can use chocolate or custard as fillings, depending on your preference.
<br>
<br>
For Cooking:
<br>
Butter or oil for greasing the taiyaki mold
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Make the Batter:
In a mixing bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Mix well.
In another bowl, whisk together the egg, milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract.
Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, stirring until you get a smooth batter. If the batter is too thick, add a little water to reach a pourable consistency (similar to pancake batter).
<br>
2.Prepare the Taiyaki Mold:
Preheat a taiyaki pan over medium heat. If you don‚Äôt have a taiyaki mold, you can use a fish-shaped waffle maker as a substitute.
Lightly grease both sides of the mold with butter or oil.
<br>
3.Fill the Molds:
Pour a small amount of batter into the bottom half of the taiyaki mold, just enough to cover the bottom.
Add a spoonful of your desired filling (red bean paste, custard, chocolate, etc.) in the center, then cover with more batter to seal the filling inside.
<br>
4.Cook the Taiyaki:
Close the taiyaki mold and cook on medium heat for about 3-5 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Keep flipping the mold carefully every few minutes to make sure both sides cook evenly.
You may need to adjust the heat depending on how quickly the taiyaki is browning. Be careful not to burn it!
<br>
5.Serve:
Once cooked, remove the taiyaki from the mold and let it cool slightly. The outer shell will be crispy, and the inside will be warm and filled with the sweet filling.
Serve immediately, and enjoy your freshly made taiyaki!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Fillings: Besides red bean paste (anko), you can use custard, sweet potato, or chocolate as fillings. Feel free to get creative with your own fillings!
<br>
Texture: If you prefer a more golden and crispy exterior, try adding a little extra butter to the batter.
<br>
Mold Options: If you don‚Äôt have a taiyaki pan, you can use a waffle maker with a fish-shaped mold or even make them in a regular waffle iron, though the traditional fish shape might be harder to achieve.
<br>
Enjoy your homemade taiyaki‚Äîcrispy, warm, and absolutely delicious! üç£üêü

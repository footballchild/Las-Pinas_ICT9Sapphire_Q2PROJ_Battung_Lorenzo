		Japanese Iced Tea
	</h1>
Japanese iced tea is a refreshing and subtle drink that combines the delicate flavors of traditional Japanese tea with the coolness of ice. There are various types of Japanese tea you can use, such as Sencha (green tea) or Genmaicha (green tea with roasted rice). Below is a simple recipe for making Japanese Iced Tea using Sencha.
<br>
<br>
Japanese Iced Tea Recipe (Sencha)
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
2 teaspoons loose-leaf Sencha green tea (or 2 tea bags)
<br>
2 cups (500 ml) hot water (around 170-175°F / 75-80°C, slightly below boiling)
<br>
Ice cubes
<br>
1-2 teaspoons sugar or honey (optional, depending on your sweetness preference)
<br>
Lemon slices or mint leaves (optional, for garnish)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
1.Brew the Tea:
Heat water to around 170-175°F (75-80°C), just below boiling. If you don’t have a thermometer, you can let boiling water cool for about 2-3 minutes before using it.
Add the loose-leaf Sencha green tea (or tea bags) into a teapot or heatproof container.
Pour the hot water over the tea leaves, and let it steep for 1-2 minutes. Do not over-brew, as Sencha can become bitter with longer steeping times.
After steeping, strain the tea into a bowl or another container to remove the tea leaves, or simply remove the tea bags.
<br>
2.Cool the Tea:
Allow the brewed tea to cool to room temperature. If you’re in a hurry, you can place the tea in the fridge to cool more quickly.
<br>
3.Prepare the Iced Tea:
Fill a glass with ice cubes.
Pour the cooled tea over the ice. The ice will quickly chill the tea and dilute it slightly, making it a perfect refreshing iced drink.
<br>
4.Optional Sweetening:
If you like your tea sweetened, stir in 1-2 teaspoons of sugar or honey while the tea is still warm so it dissolves easily.
<br>
5.Serve and Garnish:
Garnish with a slice of lemon or a sprig of mint if desired. These additions are optional but give a nice touch to the presentation and add a bit of extra flavor.
<br>
6.Enjoy:
Serve and enjoy your Japanese Iced Tea! It’s the perfect refreshing beverage for hot weather or to accompany a meal.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Quality of Tea: For the best flavor, use high-quality Sencha or another Japanese green tea. Fresh, loose-leaf tea typically yields a better result than pre-bagged tea.
Chilled Green Tea: If you prefer a more traditional method, you can chill the brewed tea in the fridge overnight before serving it over ice.
<br>
Cold Brew Method: Alternatively, you can make a cold brew version of Japanese iced tea by steeping Sencha in cold water for 6-8 hours in the fridge. This creates a smoother, less bitter flavor compared to hot-brewed tea.
<br>
Enjoy this Japanese Iced Tea for a delicate, refreshing treat!

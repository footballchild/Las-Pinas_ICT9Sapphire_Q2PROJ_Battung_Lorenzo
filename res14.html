		Tempura
	</h1>
Tempura is a popular Japanese dish consisting of seafood, vegetables, or other ingredients dipped in a light batter and deep-fried until crispy. The key to good tempura is a light, crispy batter and frying the ingredients at the right temperature. Here's a simple recipe to make Tempura:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Tempura Batter:
<br>
1 cup all-purpose flour (or use cake flour for a lighter texture)
<br>
1/4 cup cornstarch
<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder
<br>
1/2 teaspoon salt
<br>
1 large egg (cold)
<br>
3/4 cup ice-cold sparkling water (or regular cold water)
<br>
For the Tempura:
<br>
1/2 lb shrimp (peeled and deveined, tails on or off)
<br>
1 medium zucchini (sliced into rounds or strips)
<br>
1 large sweet potato (peeled and sliced into thin rounds or sticks)
<br>
1/2 cup mushrooms (shiitake, enoki, or button mushrooms, sliced)
<br>
1/2 onion (cut into rings)
<br>
1 cup ice (to keep the batter cold)
<br>
Vegetable oil (for deep frying)
<br>
For the Tempura Dipping Sauce (Tentsuyu):
<br>
1/4 cup soy sauce
<br>
1/4 cup mirin (sweet rice wine)
<br>
1/4 cup dashi stock (or water if you don't have dashi)
<br>
1 teaspoon grated daikon radish (optional, for garnish)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Ingredients:
For Shrimp: Peel and devein the shrimp, leaving the tails on if desired. Pat them dry with a paper towel.
For Vegetables: Slice the zucchini, sweet potato, mushrooms, and onion into thin, uniform slices. Keep the slices consistent in size to ensure even frying.
<br>
2. Prepare the Tempura Dipping Sauce (Tentsuyu):
In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, and dashi stock (or water). Bring to a gentle simmer over low heat. Once warm, remove from heat and let it cool.
If desired, you can grate a small amount of daikon radish into the sauce for extra flavor.
<br>
3. Make the Tempura Batter:
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt.
In a separate bowl, lightly beat the cold egg.
Add the cold egg and ice-cold sparkling water to the dry ingredients. Stir gently with chopsticks or a fork. The batter should be slightly lumpy—don't overmix it. The key to crispy tempura is having a cold, lumpy batter.
Keep the batter chilled by placing the mixing bowl over a bowl of ice.
<br>
4. Heat the Oil:
Heat about 2-3 inches of vegetable oil in a deep pan or wok to 350°F (175°C). You can test the temperature by dropping a small bit of batter into the oil. If it sizzles and floats to the surface quickly, the oil is ready.
<br>
5. Fry the Tempura:
Dip the prepared shrimp and vegetables into the tempura batter, coating them lightly and evenly.
Carefully drop the battered ingredients into the hot oil, one at a time. Fry in small batches to avoid overcrowding.
Fry the tempura for about 2-3 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy. The shrimp should turn pink and opaque, while the vegetables should be tender and crisp.
Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the tempura from the oil and drain it on a paper towel-lined plate.
<br>
6. Serve:
Serve the tempura hot with a small bowl of tempura dipping sauce (tentsuyu) on the side for dipping.
Garnish with grated daikon radish if desired.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Cold Batter: The colder the batter, the crispier the tempura. Use ice-cold water (sparkling water gives extra crispiness) and refrigerate the ingredients and batter before frying.
<br>
Frying Temperature: Keep the oil temperature steady between 340-350°F (170-175°C) for the best results. If the oil is too hot, the tempura will burn; too cool, and it will be soggy.
<br>
Serving: Tempura is best served immediately after frying while it's hot and crispy. You can serve it with rice, noodles, or as an appetizer.
Enjoy your homemade Tempura, a crispy, light, and flavorful treat!

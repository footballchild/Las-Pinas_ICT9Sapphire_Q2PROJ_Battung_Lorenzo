Dango is a traditional Japanese dumpling made from rice flour (often served on skewers). It's chewy and can be served in a variety of ways, often with a sweet soy sauce glaze. Here's a simple recipe for making Dango:
<br>
<br>
Dango Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 cup sweet rice flour (known as shiratamako or mochi flour)
<br>
1/4 cup water (adjust as needed)
<br>
2 tablespoons sugar (optional, for sweetness)
<br>
Soy sauce (for dipping or glazing)
<br>
1 tablespoon mirin (optional, for a slight sweetness in the sauce)
<br>
1 tablespoon sugar (for the sauce)
<br>
Skewers (bamboo or metal, optional)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Make the Dango Dough:
In a mixing bowl, combine the sweet rice flour and sugar (if using).
Slowly add water, a little at a time, mixing with your hands or a spoon to form a dough. The dough should be firm but slightly sticky. You may need to adjust the water or flour slightly depending on the texture.
Knead the dough for a few minutes until it's smooth and well combined.
<br>
2.Form the Dango Balls:
Divide the dough into small portions (about 1 to 1.5-inch pieces). Roll each portion into a ball using your hands.
If you're using skewers, gently thread 3-4 balls onto each skewer, leaving a little space between them.
<br>
3.Boil the Dango:
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, carefully drop the dango balls (or skewers with dango) into the water.
Boil the dango for about 5-7 minutes, or until they float to the surface. Once they float, let them cook for an additional 1-2 minutes.
Remove the dango from the water using a slotted spoon and set them aside to cool slightly.
<br>
4.Make the Soy Sauce Glaze:
In a small pan, combine soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Heat the mixture over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves and the sauce thickens slightly (about 3-5 minutes).
Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.
<br>
5.Serve the Dango:
Once the dango are slightly cool but still warm, drizzle them with the soy sauce glaze or serve the glaze on the side for dipping. You can also lightly grill the dango on a pan or grill for a slightly charred flavor before glazing, but this is optional.
<br>
6.Enjoy:

Serve the dango on skewers and enjoy your homemade treat!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Flavor Variations: You can add a bit of matcha powder to the dough for a green tea flavor, or roll the cooked dango in sweet bean paste (anko) for a different twist.
<br>
Grilling: If you prefer a slightly crispy texture, you can grill the dango skewers over low heat for a minute or two before glazing.
<br>
Sweetness: Adjust the sweetness of the soy sauce glaze by adding more or less sugar to your preference.
<br>
Dango is a fun and delicious treat, perfect for festivals or just as a sweet snack! Enjoy making your dango!

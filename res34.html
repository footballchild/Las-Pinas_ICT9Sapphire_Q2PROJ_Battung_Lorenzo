Halo-Halo Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Base (the mix-ins):
<br>
1 cup sweetened red beans (or kidney beans)
<br>
1 cup sweetened jackfruit (sliced)
<br>
1/2 cup sweetened banana (saba) slices in syrup
<br>
1/2 cup nata de coco (coconut gel), drained
<br>
1/2 cup macapuno (sweetened coconut sport), drained
<br>
1/2 cup sweetened mung beans (optional)
<br>
1/4 cup sweetened white or purple yam (ube) (optional, but recommended for the signature flavor)
<br>
1/2 cup shaved ice (or crushed ice)
<br>
1 tablespoon sugar (to taste, optional)
<br>
For the Toppings:
<br>
1 scoop ube ice cream (optional but highly recommended)
<br>
1-2 tablespoons leche flan (homemade or store-bought)
<br>
Evaporated milk (about 1/4 cup per serving)
<br>
Pinipig (toasted rice flakes, optional)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Prepare the Base Ingredients:
Sweetened red beans: You can buy these canned or make them by simmering kidney beans with sugar until they are soft and sweet.
Sweetened jackfruit: If using fresh jackfruit, slice and cook in sugar syrup. Canned or jarred sweetened jackfruit works fine as well.
Banana (Saba): Slice the bananas and cook in syrup (or use canned sweetened bananas).
Nata de coco and Macapuno: These are both coconut-based treats you can buy from the store, usually in jars.
Sweetened mung beans and Ube: Both can be bought canned, or you can prepare them at home by cooking the mung beans and mashed ube with sugar and milk.
<br>
2.Assemble the Halo-Halo:
In a tall glass or bowl, add a generous amount of sweetened beans, jackfruit, banana slices, nata de coco, macapuno, and mung beans.
Add a few spoonfuls of the sweetened ube and a small layer of shaved ice on top.
If you prefer, you can sprinkle a little sugar for extra sweetness at this stage (optional).
<br>
3.Add the Toppings:
Add a scoop of ube ice cream on top of the shaved ice.
Add slices of leche flan for a creamy, caramelized topping.
Optionally, sprinkle some pinipig (toasted rice flakes) for extra crunch.
<br>
4.Pour the Milk:
Drizzle evaporated milk over the top to bind everything together. The milk adds a creamy texture to the dish and ties the flavors together.
<br>
5.Mix and Enjoy:
Mix it up! Halo-Halo is meant to be mixed together, so stir everything well to combine the different ingredients. The result will be a refreshing and colorful dessert with a variety of textures and flavors.
<br>
6.Serve Immediately:
Serve your Halo-Halo with a spoon and straw, and enjoy the refreshing mix of flavors and textures!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Customizing: Halo-Halo is highly customizable! You can add other ingredients like taro or pandan jelly depending on what you like.
<br>
Cold toppings: If you want, you can freeze the leche flan or ube ice cream beforehand for an even colder dessert.
<br>
Fresh fruits: Some variations of Halo-Halo use fresh fruits like mango, pineapple, or melon.
<br>
This Halo-Halo recipe is perfect for a hot day or for a special occasion with family and friends. It's fun, colorful, and packed with so many delicious flavors!

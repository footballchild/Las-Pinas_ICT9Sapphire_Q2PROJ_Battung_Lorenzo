		Salmon Teriyaki
	</h1>
Salmon Teriyaki is a popular Japanese dish featuring salmon fillets cooked in a sweet and savory teriyaki sauce. The fish is typically pan-seared or grilled, glazed with the teriyaki sauce, and served with rice or vegetables. Here’s a simple and delicious recipe for Salmon Teriyaki:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Teriyaki Sauce:
<br>
1/4 cup soy sauce
<br>
2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)
<br>
2 tablespoons honey or brown sugar (adjust for sweetness)
<br>
1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
<br>
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger (optional, for extra flavor)
<br>
1 clove garlic, minced (optional, for extra flavor)
<br>
1 teaspoon cornstarch (optional, to thicken the sauce)
<br>
2 tablespoons water (if using cornstarch to thicken)
<br>
For the Salmon:
<br>
2 salmon fillets (skin-on or skinless, your choice)
<br>
1 tablespoon vegetable oil (for searing)
<br>
Salt and pepper, to taste
<br>
Sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)
<br>
Chopped green onions (optional, for garnish)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Make the Teriyaki Sauce:
In a small saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, honey (or brown sugar), rice vinegar, and grated ginger (if using).
Heat the saucepan over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar or honey. Allow the sauce to simmer for 2-3 minutes, then taste and adjust sweetness or saltiness as desired.
If you'd like a thicker sauce, mix 1 teaspoon of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water, then slowly whisk this into the sauce. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens, about 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
<br>
2. Prepare the Salmon:
Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. This helps them sear better.
Season both sides of the salmon with a pinch of salt and pepper.
<br>
3. Cook the Salmon:
Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Once the oil is hot, add the salmon fillets, skin-side down (if using skin-on salmon). Sear the salmon for about 4-5 minutes on the first side, or until the skin is crispy and the fish is cooked about halfway through.
Flip the salmon over and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillet, until the fish is cooked to your preferred doneness.
Once cooked, remove the salmon from the pan and set aside.
<br>
4. Glaze the Salmon:
Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the prepared teriyaki sauce to the pan. Allow the sauce to simmer for about 1 minute to slightly thicken.
Place the salmon fillets back into the pan, spoon the sauce over the fish, and let it simmer in the sauce for 1-2 more minutes to absorb the flavors and glaze the salmon.
<br>
5. Serve:
Transfer the glazed salmon fillets to a serving plate.
Drizzle any remaining sauce over the top of the salmon.
Optionally, garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions for added texture and flavor.
Serve with steamed rice and vegetables like broccoli or sautéed spinach.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Adjust the sweetness: If you like your teriyaki sauce sweeter, you can add more honey or sugar. If you prefer it less sweet, adjust the sugar to your liking.
Cooking method: You can also grill the salmon for a smoky flavor instead of pan-searing it.
<br>
Vegetable options: Pair your salmon with steamed vegetables like bok choy, zucchini, or asparagus for a complete meal.
<br>
Salmon Teriyaki is a flavorful and quick dish that can be made in under 30 minutes, making it perfect for a weeknight dinner or a special meal. Enjoy!

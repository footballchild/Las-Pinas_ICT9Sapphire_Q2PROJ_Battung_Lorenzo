Mango Milkshake Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 ripe mango (peeled and diced)
<br>
1 cup milk (whole, almond, or any milk of your choice)
<br>
1/2 cup vanilla ice cream (optional, for a richer shake)
<br>
2 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)
<br>
A pinch of cardamom powder (optional, for extra flavor)
<br>
Ice cubes (optional, for a colder shake)
<br>
Whipped cream (optional, for topping)
<br>Mango slices or mint leaves (optional, for garnish)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Prepare the Mango:
Peel and dice the mango, removing the pit. Make sure the mango is ripe for the best sweetness and flavor.
<br>
2.Blend the Ingredients:
In a blender, combine the diced mango, milk, vanilla ice cream (if using), sugar, and cardamom powder (optional).
Blend until smooth and creamy. If you want a colder, thicker consistency, add a few ice cubes and blend again.
<br>
3.Taste and Adjust:
Taste your milkshake. If it’s not sweet enough, add a little more sugar. If you prefer it thinner, add a little more milk and blend again.
<br>
4.Serve:
Pour the milkshake into glasses. For an extra indulgence, top with whipped cream, mango slices, or a sprig of mint.
<br>
5.Enjoy:
Serve immediately and enjoy your refreshing mango milkshake!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Mango Selection: Use a ripe mango for the best flavor. If you're using frozen mango chunks, this can make your milkshake even thicker and colder.
<br>
Sweetener Alternatives: You can replace sugar with honey, agave syrup, or a sugar substitute if preferred.
<br>
Vegan Version: Use plant-based milk (like almond or coconut milk) and dairy-free ice cream for a vegan version of this milkshake.
<br>
This Mango Milkshake is the perfect creamy, fruity treat for any occasion!

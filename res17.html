		Soy Chicken
	</h1>
Here's a simple and tasty Soy Chicken recipe that combines savory, salty, and slightly sweet flavors. It’s an easy dish to make with a delicious marinade, perfect for dinner!
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
4 chicken thighs (bone-in or boneless, skin-on or skinless)
<br>
2 tablespoons soy sauce (low-sodium is an option)
<br>
1 tablespoon oyster sauce
<br>
1 tablespoon hoisin sauce (optional, for extra sweetness)
<br>
1 tablespoon brown sugar or honey
<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced
<br>
1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated or minced
<br>
1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or white vinegar)
<br>
1 tablespoon sesame oil
<br>
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
<br>
1 tablespoon cooking oil (vegetable or canola)
<br>
1/4 cup water or chicken broth (for cooking)
<br>
Chopped green onions, for garnish
<br>
Sesame seeds (optional), for garnish
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Marinade:
In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce (if using), brown sugar or honey, minced garlic, grated ginger, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and black pepper. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and all the ingredients are well mixed.
<br>
2. Marinate the Chicken:
Place the chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken, ensuring it’s evenly coated.
Seal the bag or cover the dish and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour (or overnight for deeper flavor).
<br>
3. Cook the Chicken:
Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat.
Remove the chicken from the marinade (reserve the marinade for later) and cook the chicken on both sides until golden brown and cooked through, about 6-7 minutes per side for bone-in thighs (or 4-5 minutes per side for boneless).
If using bone-in chicken, make sure the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
<br>
4. Simmer the Sauce:
Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pan and set aside.
Add the reserved marinade to the same pan, along with 1/4 cup of water or chicken broth. Stir to combine and bring it to a simmer for 3-5 minutes, until the sauce slightly thickens.
<br>
5. Serve:
Return the chicken to the pan, spoon the sauce over it, and let it simmer for another 2 minutes to reheat and glaze the chicken with the sauce.
Garnish with chopped green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.
<br>
6. Enjoy:
Serve the Soy Chicken with steamed rice and your favorite vegetables. The savory, sweet, and tangy sauce will be perfect with the chicken! 
This recipe makes a flavorful and comforting meal that’s perfect for a quick dinner. Enjoy your Soy Chicken!

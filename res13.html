		Crispy Pata
	</h1>
Crispy Pata is a popular Filipino dish made of deep-fried pork knuckles (often served as a special treat for family gatherings or celebrations). It’s crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, typically served with a dipping sauce like vinegar with garlic, soy sauce, and chili. Here's a step-by-step recipe to make Crispy Pata:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Pork Knuckles:
<br>
1 whole pork pata (pork knuckle, about 2-3 lbs)
<br>
1 medium onion, quartered
<br>
1 head garlic, halved
<br>
2 bay leaves
<br>
1 tablespoon peppercorns
<br>
1 teaspoon salt (for boiling)
<br>
1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional, for extra flavor)
<br>
Water (enough to submerge the pork)
<br>
For the Crispy Coating:
<br>
1 cup cornstarch
<br>
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
<br>
1 teaspoon baking powder
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
For Frying:
<br>
Vegetable oil (enough to fully submerge the pork)
<br>
For the Dipping Sauce:
<br>
1/4 cup vinegar
<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced
<br>
1 tablespoon soy sauce
<br>
1 small chili (optional)
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Pork Pata:
Clean the pork knuckles: Wash the pork knuckles thoroughly, and use a knife or kitchen torch to remove any remaining hairs.
<br>
2. Boil the Pork Pata:
In a large pot, add the pork knuckles, onion, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt. Pour enough water to fully submerge the pork.
Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 2-3 hours (or until the pork is tender but not falling apart). You may need to occasionally add more water to keep the pork submerged.
Optionally, add a tablespoon of soy sauce for extra flavor during the boiling process.
Once the pork is tender, remove it from the pot and let it cool down for a while. You can save the broth for other dishes or soups.
<br>
3. Prepare the Crispy Coating:
Pat the pork knuckles dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture (this will help achieve a crispy exterior).
In a shallow bowl, mix the cornstarch, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper.
Roll the boiled and dried pork knuckles in the coating mixture, ensuring that the pork is evenly covered.
<br>
4. Fry the Pork Pata:
Heat vegetable oil in a large pot or deep fryer. You’ll need enough oil to fully submerge the pork knuckles.
Once the oil reaches 350°F (175°C), carefully lower the coated pork knuckles into the hot oil. Fry for about 10-15 minutes, or until the skin turns golden brown and crispy.
Be careful when frying, as the oil may splatter when you add the pork.
Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the crispy pata from the oil and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.
<br>
5. Prepare the Dipping Sauce:
In a small bowl, mix the vinegar, minced garlic, soy sauce, and chili (if using). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Stir the sauce well and set it aside for dipping.
<br>
6. Serve:
Once the crispy pata is fried to perfection, transfer it to a serving platter.
Slice the pork into manageable portions (using a cleaver or sharp knife) and serve with the dipping sauce on the side.
You can serve it with steamed rice and a side of pickled vegetables (like atchara) for a complete meal.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Boiling the Pork: Boiling the pork first is crucial as it tenderizes the meat, making it juicy inside while ensuring a crispy exterior when fried. You can boil it the day before and refrigerate it overnight for easier handling.
<br>
Frying: Make sure the oil is hot enough before frying to ensure the skin crisps up properly. Frying at the right temperature is key to achieving that perfect crunch.
<br>
Extra Crispy: For even crispier results, some people recommend freezing the boiled pork knuckles for a couple of hours before frying.
<br>
Crispy Pata is a fun and indulgent dish that pairs perfectly with family gatherings and special occasions. The crispy exterior and tender meat inside, combined with the vinegar-based dipping sauce, make it irresistible! Enjoy!

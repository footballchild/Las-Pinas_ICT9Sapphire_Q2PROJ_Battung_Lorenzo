<h1>Tapsilog</h1>

Tapsilog is a popular Filipino breakfast dish that combines tapa (marinated beef), sinangag (garlic rice), and itlog (fried egg). Here's a recipe to make this delicious meal at home.

Ingredients:
For the Tapa (Marinated Beef):
500g beef sirloin or beef round (thinly sliced against the grain)
<br>
4 cloves garlic (minced)
<br>
2 tbsp soy sauce
<br>
2 tbsp vinegar
<br>
2 tbsp brown sugar
<br>
1 tsp salt
<br>
1/2 tsp ground black pepper
<br>
1 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil (for frying)
<br>
1 tbsp water (optional, to adjust marinate consistency)
<br>
For the Sinangag (Garlic Rice):
<br>
2 cups cooked rice (preferably day-old rice)
<br>
4 cloves garlic (minced)
<br>
2 tbsp vegetable oil or butter
<br>
Salt to taste
<br>
For the Itlog (Fried Egg):
<br>
4 eggs (one per serving)
<br>
1 tbsp oil (for frying)
<br>
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Tapa (Beef Marinade):
In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
Add the sliced beef to the marinade. Ensure that all the pieces are coated well.
Cover the bowl and let the beef marinate for at least 30 minutes (you can also marinate it overnight for more flavor).
<br>
2. Cook the Sinangag (Garlic Rice):
Heat the vegetable oil or butter in a large pan over medium heat.
Add the minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant (about 1-2 minutes).
Add the cooked rice to the pan, breaking it apart with a spoon or spatula.
Stir the rice well, ensuring that the garlic is evenly distributed.
Season with salt to taste and fry for about 5-7 minutes, or until the rice is slightly crispy and golden. Set aside.
<br>
3. Cook the Tapa (Beef):
Heat the oil in a separate pan over medium-high heat.
Once the pan is hot, add the marinated beef slices in a single layer. Avoid overcrowding the pan; cook in batches if needed.
Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until the beef is cooked through and slightly caramelized. Transfer the cooked beef to a plate and set aside.
4. Fry the Itlog (Eggs):
In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed and fry the eggs one at a time to your desired doneness (sunny-side-up is traditional).
5. Assemble the Tapsilog:
On each plate, serve a generous portion of garlic rice (sinangag).
Add a portion of the cooked tapa (marinated beef) next to the rice.
Top with a fried egg (itlog) on the side.
Serve your tapsilog with a side of suka (vinegar) or toyomansi (soy sauce with calamansi) for dipping, and enjoy!
<br>
<br>
<br>
Tips:
Day-old rice works best for sinangag because it's less sticky and fries up nicely.
<br>
For tapa variations, some people add a bit of pineapple juice or calamansi for an extra twist.

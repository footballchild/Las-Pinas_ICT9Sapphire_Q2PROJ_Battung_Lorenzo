Dorayaki Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Pancakes:
<br>
2 large eggs
<br>
1/2 cup sugar
<br>
1 tablespoon honey (optional, for extra sweetness)
<br>
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
<br>
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
<br>
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
<br>
A pinch of salt
<br>
2-3 tablespoons water (to adjust the batter consistency)
<br>
Vegetable oil for cooking
<br>
For the Filling:
<br>
Sweet red bean paste (anko), store-bought or homemade (you’ll need about 1/2 cup)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Prepare the Pancake Batter:
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk the eggs and sugar together until the mixture becomes smooth and light in color. This may take about 1-2 minutes.
Add the honey (if using) and vanilla extract, then whisk again to combine.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Gradually sift this dry mixture into the egg mixture while gently folding to combine. You can add a small amount of water if the batter is too thick. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter.
<br>
2.Cook the Pancakes:
Heat a non-stick frying pan or griddle over medium-low heat and lightly grease it with vegetable oil or use a paper towel to wipe the oil off, leaving only a thin coating.
Using a ladle or small measuring cup, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the pan, forming small round pancakes. Let the batter spread out naturally.
Cook for about 2-3 minutes on one side. You'll see small bubbles forming on the surface. Once the bubbles start to pop, flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side, or until both sides are golden brown.
Repeat with the remaining batter, and set the pancakes aside to cool.
<br>
3.Assemble the Dorayaki:
Once the pancakes have cooled slightly, spread a generous amount of anko (sweet red bean paste) on one pancake. Place another pancake on top to make a sandwich.
Gently press down on the top pancake to ensure the filling sticks and the dorayaki holds together.
<br>
4.Serve:
Your dorayaki is now ready to enjoy! They can be served immediately or stored in an airtight container for up to a few days.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Filling Options: While traditional dorayaki is filled with red bean paste (anko), you can also use matcha cream, chocolate ganache, or sweetened whipped cream for variety.
<br>
Batter Texture: If the batter is too thick, add a little water to thin it out, but don't make it too runny. The batter should be pourable but not too liquid.
<br>
Serving: Dorayaki is best enjoyed fresh, but you can also refrigerate them and warm them up slightly before serving.
<br>
Enjoy your fluffy, sweet dorayaki filled with smooth red bean paste! It’s a classic Japanese treat that’s sure to impress.

		Mochi
	</h1>	
Here's a simple recipe for Mochi, the chewy, sweet Japanese rice cake, often enjoyed as a dessert. This version uses shiratamako (glutinous rice flour) to make the dough, and you can fill it with sweet fillings like red bean paste or even ice cream.
<br>
<br>
Mochi Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Mochi Dough:
<br>
1 cup shiratamako (glutinous rice flour, not regular rice flour)
<br>
1/4 cup sugar (adjust based on sweetness preference)
<br>
1/2 cup water (more as needed)
<br>
Cornstarch or potato starch (for dusting and preventing sticking)
<br>
<br>
For the Filling (optional):
<br>
Sweet red bean paste (anko) or ice cream (matcha, vanilla, or any flavor of choice)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Prepare the Mochi Dough:
In a heatproof bowl, combine the shiratamako (glutinous rice flour), sugar, and water. Mix well until smooth. The mixture will be very runny at this stage.
<br>
2.Steam the Dough:
Fill a large steamer with water and bring it to a boil.
Pour the mochi mixture into a heatproof dish or shallow pan (you can also line the dish with parchment paper for easier removal).
Place the dish in the steamer and cover. Steam for about 20-30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to ensure even cooking. The dough will thicken and turn slightly translucent when it’s ready. It should be sticky and chewy when done.
<br>
3.Cool the Mochi Dough:
Once steamed, remove the dish from the steamer and let the dough cool for about 5-10 minutes until it’s manageable but still warm.
<br>
4.Shape the Mochi:
Dust your work surface generously with cornstarch or potato starch to prevent the mochi from sticking.
When the dough is cool enough to handle, lightly dust your hands with starch, then divide the dough into small portions (about 1-2 tablespoons per piece). Flatten each portion into a small disk with your hands.
<br>
5.Add the Filling (optional):
If you’re adding a filling like red bean paste, place a small ball of filling in the center of each mochi disk. Gently pinch the edges of the dough together and roll it into a ball, ensuring the filling is completely enclosed. If you're using ice cream, freeze it first and form the mochi around the frozen ice cream balls.
<br>
6.Serve:
Once shaped, dust the outside of the mochi with a little more cornstarch or potato starch to prevent it from sticking.
Serve immediately, or refrigerate if you want them cold. If you’ve filled the mochi with ice cream, keep them in the freezer until ready to serve.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Flavoring the Dough: You can add a bit of matcha powder or cocoa powder to the dough for a flavored mochi.
<br>
Ice Cream Mochi: If using ice cream, be sure it’s hard-frozen before wrapping it with the mochi dough so it doesn’t melt.
<br>
Storage: Mochi is best enjoyed fresh, but if you have leftovers, keep them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a day, or in the refrigerator for a couple of days.
<br>
Enjoy your chewy, sweet homemade mochi!

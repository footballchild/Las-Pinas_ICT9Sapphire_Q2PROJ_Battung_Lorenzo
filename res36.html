<br>
<br>
Matcha Cheesecake Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Crust:
<br>
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs (or digestive biscuit crumbs)
<br>
1/4 cup granulated sugar
<br>
1/2 cup unsalted butter (melted)
<br>
For the Filling:
<br>
16 oz (2 cups) cream cheese (softened)
<br>
1/2 cup granulated sugar
<br>
2 large eggs
<br>
1/2 cup heavy cream
<br>
2 tbsp matcha powder (sifted)
<br>
1 tsp vanilla extract
<br>
1 tbsp all-purpose flour (optional, helps stabilize the filling)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Prepare the Crust:
Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).
In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter. Stir until the crumbs are evenly coated with butter and the mixture has a sandy texture.
Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan to form the crust. Use the back of a spoon to pack it down tightly.
Bake the crust in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until it’s lightly golden. Set aside to cool while you prepare the filling.
<br>
2.Prepare the Matcha Filling:
In a small bowl, sift the matcha powder to remove any lumps.
In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together until smooth and creamy. You can use an electric mixer or whisk.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Add the heavy cream, sifted matcha powder, and vanilla extract. Mix until the matcha is fully incorporated and the batter is smooth. If you're using flour, add it at this point and mix until smooth.
<br>
3.Assemble the Cheesecake:
Pour the matcha filling over the cooled graham cracker crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula.
Tap the pan gently on the counter to remove any air bubbles.
<br>
4.Bake the Cheesecake:
Bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven at 325°F (160°C) for 50-60 minutes. The center should still be slightly jiggly but firm when you tap the pan. It will continue to set as it cools.
If the top starts to brown too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.
<br>
5.Cool and Chill:
Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool in the oven with the door slightly open for about 1 hour. This helps prevent cracks.
Once cooled, remove the cheesecake from the oven and transfer it to the fridge. Let it chill for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, to set.
<br>
6.Serve:
Before serving, you can top your matcha cheesecake with whipped cream, fresh fruit, or a dusting of additional matcha powder for decoration.
Slice, serve, and enjoy!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Matcha Quality: Use high-quality culinary grade matcha powder for the best flavor.
<br>
No Cracks: If you're worried about cracks, try baking the cheesecake in a water bath. <br>
Wrap the outside of the pan with foil and place it in a larger pan filled with hot water to create a gentle steam environment.
<br>
Optional Toppings: You can top the cheesecake with a little drizzle of honey, matcha syrup, or even red bean paste for an authentic Japanese twist!
<br>
This Matcha Cheesecake has a lovely balance of creaminess and matcha's earthy flavor, making it a perfect treat for any occasion!

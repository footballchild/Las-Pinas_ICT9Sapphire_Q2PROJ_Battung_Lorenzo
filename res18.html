Gyudon (牛丼) is a popular Japanese dish featuring thinly sliced beef simmered in a sweet-savory sauce, served over steamed rice. It's a quick and delicious meal that’s easy to make at home! Here’s a simple recipe for Gyudon:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Gyudon:
<br>
1 lb (450g) thinly sliced beef (ribeye, sirloin, or brisket work well)
<br>
1 medium onion, thinly sliced
<br>
2 tablespoons soy sauce
<br>
2 tablespoons mirin
<br>
1 tablespoon sake (or dry white wine as a substitute)
<br>
1 tablespoon sugar (brown or white)
<br>
1/2 cup dashi (or 1 cup of water with 1/2 teaspoon dashi powder)
<br>
1 teaspoon ginger (grated)
<br>
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
<br>
4 cups steamed white rice (for serving)
<br>
Pickled ginger (beni shoga) for garnish (optional)
<br>
Chopped green onions (optional, for garnish)
<br>
1-2 soft-boiled eggs (optional, for garnish)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Ingredients:
If using frozen beef, thaw it and then slice it as thinly as possible. A partially frozen block of beef is easier to slice thinly. You can also ask your butcher to slice it thin for you.
Slice the onion into thin strips and set aside.
<br>
2. Make the Sauce:
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, and grated ginger. Stir to dissolve the sugar, and set the sauce aside.
<br>
3. Cook the Onions:
Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat.
Add the sliced onions and sauté them until they become soft and translucent, about 3-5 minutes.
<br>
4. Add the Beef:
Push the onions to one side of the pan and add another teaspoon of vegetable oil.
Add the thinly sliced beef to the pan. Stir-fry the beef until it’s no longer pink, about 2-3 minutes.
<br>
5. Simmer the Gyudon:
Once the beef is cooked, pour the sauce mixture into the pan. Add the dashi (or water with dashi powder) and stir to combine.
Bring to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. The liquid should reduce slightly, and the sauce should thicken to a syrupy consistency.
<br>
6. Serve:
Spoon the steamed rice into bowls.
Top each bowl of rice with the beef and onion mixture, ensuring that the sauce soaks into the rice.
Garnish with pickled ginger, chopped green onions, and a soft-boiled egg (if desired).
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Dashi: This is a key ingredient in many Japanese dishes and gives the gyudon its distinctive umami flavor. You can use instant dashi powder or make your own from kombu (seaweed) and bonito flakes if you have the time.
<br>
Soft-boiled eggs: For an authentic touch, add a soft-boiled egg on top of the gyudon. The creamy yolk mixes with the sauce, making the dish even richer and more delicious.
<br>
Enjoy your homemade Gyudon, a comforting and flavorful Japanese beef bowl!

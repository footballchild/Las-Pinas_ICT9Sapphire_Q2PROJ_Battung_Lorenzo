<br>
<br>
Caramel Iced Coffee Recipe
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
1 cup brewed coffee (chilled) or strong brewed coffee
<br>
2 tablespoons caramel sauce (store-bought or homemade)
<br>
1/2 cup milk (whole, almond, oat, or any milk of your choice)
<br>
Ice cubes
<br>
Whipped cream (optional, for topping)
<br>
Extra caramel sauce (for drizzling)
<br>
1-2 teaspoons sugar (optional, depending on sweetness preference)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1.Brew the Coffee:
Brew 1 cup of strong coffee. You can use a regular coffee maker or a French press. Let the coffee cool to room temperature or place it in the fridge to chill.
<br>
2.Prepare the Caramel Sauce:
If you're using store-bought caramel sauce, no need to do anything extra.
If you'd like to make homemade caramel sauce, simply heat 1/2 cup of sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until it melts into a golden syrup. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and stir until melted, then mix in 1/4 cup of heavy cream and simmer for about 2 minutes. Let it cool slightly before using.
<br>
3.Assemble the Iced Coffee:
In a glass, add a generous amount of ice cubes.
Pour the chilled coffee over the ice.
Add 2 tablespoons of caramel sauce into the coffee and stir until fully mixed.
Pour in milk (adjust to your taste for creaminess).
<br>
4.Sweeten (Optional):
Taste your iced coffee. If you'd like it sweeter, add 1-2 teaspoons of sugar or more caramel sauce, and stir to combine.
<br>
5.Garnish and Serve:
Top with a dollop of whipped cream if desired, and drizzle some extra caramel sauce over the whipped cream for that beautiful finish.
<br>
6.Enjoy:
Stir and enjoy your homemade Caramel Iced Coffee!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Coffee Strength: Use a strong brew of coffee or espresso for the best flavor, especially since the ice will dilute the drink a bit.
<br>
Cold Brew Option: For a smoother, less acidic taste, you can use cold brew coffee instead of hot brewed coffee.
<br>
Dairy-Free Version: For a dairy-free or vegan option, use plant-based milk like almond milk, oat milk, or coconut milk.
<br>
Caramel Flavor: Adjust the amount of caramel sauce based on how sweet or caramel-flavored you prefer your iced coffee.
<br>
This Caramel Iced Coffee is perfect for a hot day or as a sweet pick-me-up. Enjoy!

		Katsilog
	</h1>
Katsilog is a Filipino-inspired take on the Japanese Katsudon, combining the classic crispy pork cutlet (tonkatsu) with sinangag (garlic fried rice) and a fried egg. It’s a hearty, flavorful meal that's perfect for breakfast or lunch. Here’s a recipe for Katsilog:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Tonkatsu (Crispy Pork Cutlet):
<br>
2 boneless pork chops or pork loin slices (about 1/2-inch thick)
<br>
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
<br>
1 large egg (beaten)
<br>
1 cup panko breadcrumbs (Japanese-style breadcrumbs)
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
Vegetable oil (for frying)
<br>
For the Garlic Fried Rice (Sinangag):
<br>
2 cups cooked rice (preferably cold, day-old rice works best)
<br>
2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter
<br>
3-4 cloves garlic (minced)
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
For the Fried Egg:
<br>
2 large eggs
<br>
1 tablespoon oil (for frying)
<br>
Salt and pepper to taste
<br>
<br>
Optional Garnish:
<br>
Chopped green onions
<br>
Pickled vegetables (like atsara)
<br>
Tonkatsu sauce or soy sauce
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Prepare the Pork Cutlets (Tonkatsu):
Tenderize: If your pork chops are thick, tenderize them with a meat mallet until they are about 1/2 inch thick.
Season: Season both sides of the pork with salt and pepper.
Breading: Set up a breading station:
Place the flour in one shallow dish.
Beat the egg in another shallow dish.
Place the panko breadcrumbs in a third shallow dish.
Dredge each pork cutlet in flour, making sure to coat it evenly. Dip it in the beaten egg, and then coat it with panko breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere the breadcrumbs.
Fry: Heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the breaded pork cutlets to the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.
Once cooked, remove the pork from the pan and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Let it rest for a couple of minutes, then slice it into strips.
<br>
2. Make the Garlic Fried Rice (Sinangag):
In the same pan (you can remove excess oil), heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or butter over medium heat.
Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until fragrant and golden brown.
Add the cold, day-old rice to the pan. Use a spoon or spatula to break up any clumps, and stir-fry the rice for 3-5 minutes until heated through and slightly crispy.
Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set the rice aside and keep it warm.
<br>
3. Fry the Eggs:
In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium heat.
Crack the eggs into the pan and fry them sunny-side-up or to your preferred level of doneness. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
<br>
4. Assemble the Katsilog:
On a plate, serve a generous portion of garlic fried rice (sinangag).
Arrange the sliced tonkatsu (pork cutlet) on top of the rice.
Place a fried egg on top of the pork cutlet and rice.
Optionally, garnish with chopped green onions, pickled vegetables (like atsara), and drizzle with tonkatsu sauce or soy sauce for extra flavor.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Tonkatsu Sauce: If you want a more authentic touch, you can drizzle tonkatsu sauce (available in Asian grocery stores) over the tonkatsu for a savory-sweet flavor.
<br>
Rice: Day-old rice works best for fried rice as it’s drier and less likely to turn mushy when stir-fried.
<br>
Customization: You can add vegetables like shredded cabbage, carrots, or even a drizzle of gravy for more flavor.
Katsilog is a delicious, filling meal that’s a great fusion of Filipino and Japanese flavors. Enjoy this hearty combination of crispy pork, garlic fried rice, and a runny fried egg!

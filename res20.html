Here's a refreshing Lemon Iced Tea recipe that’s perfect for hot days or when you want a cold, tangy drink!
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
4-5 black tea bags (or green tea, depending on preference)
<br>
4 cups water (for brewing the tea)
<br>
1/4 to 1/2 cup sugar or honey (adjust to taste)
<br>
1-2 lemons (juice and slices)
<br>
4 cups cold water or ice
<br>
Ice cubes (for serving)
<br>
Fresh mint (optional, for garnish)
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Brew the Tea:
Boil 4 cups of water in a kettle or pot.
Once the water reaches a boil, pour it over the tea bags in a heatproof pitcher or large bowl.
Let the tea steep for 5-7 minutes (longer for stronger tea), then remove the tea bags.
Stir in the sugar or honey while the tea is still hot, until fully dissolved. If you prefer your tea sweeter, you can add more sugar to taste.
<br>
2. Cool the Tea:
Allow the tea to cool to room temperature, then place it in the fridge to chill for about 1-2 hours.
<br>
3. Add Lemon:
Once the tea is chilled, squeeze the juice of 1-2 lemons into the tea. Add more lemon juice if you like it extra tangy.
You can also slice the lemons and add them directly to the pitcher for extra flavor and a decorative touch.
<br>
4. Serve:
Fill glasses with ice cubes, and pour the chilled lemon tea over the ice.
Garnish with extra lemon slices and fresh mint (optional) for a refreshing look and flavor.
<br>
5. Enjoy:
Serve your homemade Lemon Iced Tea immediately and enjoy the cool, tangy refreshment!
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
For a sweeter iced tea: If you prefer a sweeter iced tea, add more sugar or honey, or make a simple syrup by dissolving equal parts sugar and water over heat before adding it to the tea.
<br>
For a stronger tea flavor: Let the tea steep longer or add more tea bags for a bolder taste.
<br>
Herbal twist: You can infuse your tea with mint, ginger, or other herbs while it’s steeping for added complexity.
<br>
This homemade Lemon Iced Tea is refreshing, customizable, and a perfect treat on a warm day!

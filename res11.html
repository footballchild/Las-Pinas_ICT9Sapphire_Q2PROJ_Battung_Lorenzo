		Kare-Kare
	</h1>
Kare-Kare is a traditional Filipino dish known for its rich, creamy peanut sauce, typically made with oxtail, tripe, or pork hocks. Itâ€™s often served with vegetables like eggplant, string beans, banana blossoms, and a side of shrimp paste (bagoong) for added flavor. Here's a recipe for Kare-Kare:
<br>
<br>
Ingredients:
<br>
For the Meat:
<br>
1 lb oxtail (or pork hocks, beef shank, or tripe)
<br>
1/2 lb tripes (optional, if you like a variety of meats)
<br>
1 onion, quartered
<br>
4 cloves garlic, smashed
<br>
2 bay leaves
<br>
Salt and pepper, to taste
<br>
For the Peanut Sauce:
<br>
1/2 cup peanut butter (smooth or chunky)
<br>
2 tablespoons rice flour or cornstarch (for thickening)
<br>
3 cups beef or pork broth (from the boiled meat)
<br>
1 tablespoon soy sauce (optional, for a deeper flavor)
<br>
1 tablespoon sugar (optional, to balance the savory richness)
<br>
Vegetables:
<br>
1 medium eggplant, sliced into rounds
<br>
1/2 lb string beans, ends trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces
<br>
1/2 banana blossom, sliced (optional)
<br>
1 bunch bok choy or pechay (Chinese cabbage), cut into 2-inch pieces
<br>
<br>
For Serving:
<br>
Bagoong (fermented shrimp paste) on the side
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
<br>
1. Cook the Meat:
In a large pot, add the oxtail, tripes, onion, garlic, bay leaves, and enough water to cover the meat. Season with salt and pepper.
Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer. Skim off any scum that rises to the top. Simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours (or until the meat is tender and the oxtail is soft). If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 30-40 minutes.
Once cooked, remove the meat from the broth and set it aside. Strain the broth and reserve about 3 cups for the peanut sauce.
<br>
2. Prepare the Peanut Sauce:
In a separate pan, combine the peanut butter and the reserved broth (about 3 cups) over medium heat.
Stir until the peanut butter is fully dissolved into the broth. Add rice flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce, stirring continuously until it reaches a smooth, creamy consistency.
Season the sauce with soy sauce and sugar if desired. Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper as needed.
Let the sauce simmer for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to deepen the flavor.
<br>
3. Cook the Vegetables:
In a separate pot, blanch the string beans, eggplant, banana blossom (if using), and bok choy in boiling water for about 2-3 minutes. Drain and set aside.
<br>
4. Assemble the Kare-Kare:
Once the meat is tender, add the cooked oxtail and tripes back into the peanut sauce. Stir gently to combine, and simmer for another 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
Add the cooked vegetables into the pot, and stir until well-coated with the peanut sauce. Let everything simmer together for an additional 2-3 minutes to heat the vegetables through.
<br>
5. Serve:
Transfer the Kare-Kare to a serving dish. Serve with a side of bagoong (fermented shrimp paste) for added saltiness and depth of flavor.
Enjoy the dish with steamed rice.
<br>
<br>
Tips:
<br>
Peanut Butter: You can adjust the richness of the sauce by adding more or less peanut butter depending on your preference.
<br>
Meat Choices: If you prefer, you can use other meats like pork hocks or beef shank. Some people also add pork belly for a combination of meat types.
<br>
Vegetable Variations: Feel free to use other vegetables like sitaw (string beans), kangkong (water spinach), or labanos (radish) for variety.
<br>
Bagoong: The shrimp paste served on the side provides a salty contrast to the richness of the Kare-Kare sauce.
<br>
Kare-Kare is a beloved Filipino dish that's perfect for special occasions or family meals. The combination of tender meat, creamy peanut sauce, and fresh vegetables makes it a comforting and flavorful dish. Enjoy!
